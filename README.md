# 📄 PDF Research Assistant

An AI-powered assistant designed to help users analyze, search, and summarize research papers or long PDFs efficiently. This tool combines Generative AI, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and natural language processing to let users interact with documents in an intelligent, conversational way.

## 🧠 Overview

PDF Research Assistant allows you to:
- Upload academic or technical PDFs
- Ask detailed, context-aware questions
- Receive accurate answers grounded in document content
- Summarize full documents or specific sections
- Perform fast semantic search using embeddings

Built for researchers, students, and professionals who want to extract insights from dense documents without reading them end to end.

## 🚀 Features

- 📄 Upload and analyze research or report PDFs  
- 🔍 Ask natural language questions about the content  
- ✍️ Generate document or section-wise summaries  
- ⚡ Semantic search using vector embeddings (FAISS/Chroma)  
- 🌐 Optional web-based interface (Streamlit or Flask)  

---

## 🔄 How It Works

1. **Upload** a PDF file  
2. The file is parsed and split into meaningful chunks  
3. Embeddings are generated and stored in a vector database  
4. Ask a question like _“What methodology was used in this paper?”_  
5. Relevant chunks are retrieved using semantic search  
6. The system uses an LLM to generate a precise, context-aware response  
7. Summarization option is available for the entire document or selected parts
